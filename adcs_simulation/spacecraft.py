"""Spacecraft module for attitude determination and control system.

This module stores a number of composed objects that describe the overall
spacecraft and its associated controller, gyros, etc. It is primarily used to
simplify the process of passing parameters between methods, and it has aliases
for a number of methods of its sub-objects for simplicity.
